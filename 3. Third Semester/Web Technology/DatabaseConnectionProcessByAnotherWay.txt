Describe the database connection process in PHP?
Before we start building PHP connection to MYSQL database we need to know what PHPMyAdmin is. It’s control panel from where you can manage the database that you’ve created. 
Database connection process in PHP are as follows:
1.	Create a connection 
2.	Select database
3.	Perform database query
4.	Use return data
5.	Close connection 

1.	Create a connection 
 It is very important when you want to start a dynamic website to create a connection with your SQL by using mysql_connect() function. 

2.	Select database
 To select a database we use mysal_select_db() function which the arguments are the name of the database and connection made earlier.

3.	Perform database query
In this step, we have to select out data from the database and bring it into our web page. The best decision to use mysql_query() function which it will send a MYSQL query with 2 arguments as displayed in the above code.

4.	Use return data
To display the result on your web page, you have to use while() loop function in addition to mysql_fetch_array() function which fetches a result row as an associative array, a numeric array, or both.

5.	Close connection
To close connection, it is better to use mysql_close() function to close MYSQL connec-tion. This is a very important function as it closes the connection to the database server.
